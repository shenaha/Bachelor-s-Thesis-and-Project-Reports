## Bachelor Thesis project
### Assessment of Culex Mosquito Prone Zones using Remote Sensing and GIS
2017\
•	Deciphered favorable factors for mosquito breeding and mapped the prone zones with an accuracy of 83.3%
•	Reported 24 potential breeding sites to Greater Chennai Corporation for devising mosquito control measures
•	Performed the analysis using Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS, Sentinel-2A and Aster DEM data
•	Tools used - ArcGIS, ENVI and field Larval data collection.


## Mini project
### Mapping of Total Suspended sediment concentration using remote sensing
2016
•	Prepared spatial distribution of TSS to observe the TSS concentration range from 0 to 600mg/l  in Pulicat lake using Landsat images.
•	Prompted the removal of highly concentrated sediments from the study area to combat the poor water quality
